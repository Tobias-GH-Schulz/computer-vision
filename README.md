In this repository you will find small projects I have done to start learning about computer vision. I try to make the code as clear as possible, and the goal is be to used as a learning resource and a way to lookup problems to solve specific problems. This repository is contribution friendly, so if you feel you want to add something then I'd happily merge a PR ðŸ˜ƒ

## Image processing
### Meme creator
Use case: Create a meme by loading an image and putting some text in a box on to it. <br>
Computer vision skills applied: draw rectangle, write text. <br>
Repository url: [Meme creator](https://github.com/Tobias-GH-Schulz/computer-vision/tree/main/Meme%20creator)<br>

### Green screen
Merging a green screen image with a background. (picture and video) <br>
Computer vision skills applied: Color conversion, channel splitting, masking, merging. <br>
Repository url: [Green screen](https://github.com/Tobias-GH-Schulz/computer-vision/tree/main/Green%20screen)<br>



## Object detection and tracking
### Object detection by color
Use case: Detect objects in a given image by a color. <br>
Computer vision skills applied: contour detection, thresholding, masking <br>

### Simple template matching
Use case: Detect areas in a given image that match a certain template. <br>
Computer vision skills applied: template matching <br>
Repository url: [Object detection by color](https://github.com/Tobias-GH-Schulz/computer-vision/tree/main/Object%20detection%20by%20color)<br>


### Face and eye detection
Use case: Detect faces and eyes on a given image or video. <br>
Computer vision skills applied: CascadeClassifier, frontalface classifier, eye classifier <br>
