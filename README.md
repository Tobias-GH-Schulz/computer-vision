In this repository you will find small projects I have done to start learning about computer vision. I try to make the code as clear as possible, and the goal is be to used as a learning resource and a way to lookup problems to solve specific problems. This repository is contribution friendly, so if you feel you want to add something then I'd happily merge a PR 😃
